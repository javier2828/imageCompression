This project involves digital video coding techniques. For the project, Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), Differential PCM (DPCM), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) methods are developed and compared against each other given compression ratio, signal to noise ratio, average reduced power and subjective testing.
